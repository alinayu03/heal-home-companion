Nurse: Good morning. This is Nurse Sarah calling from Heal Home Companion regarding your knee surgery last week. How are you feeling today?

Patient: Hi Nurse Sarah. I'm not feeling great today actually. I had my knee surgery last week, but I'm having some issues.

Nurse: I am sorry to hear that. To help me assess your condition, could you describe the nature and location of your pain?

Patient: Well, the pain around my knee has gotten worse since yesterday. It's more swollen than before, and it feels really warm to touch. I took my temperature and it's 100.2°F.

Nurse: Thank you. On a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain), how would you rate your current discomfort? Are you able to bear weight on the leg or flex your knee at all?

Patient: Not really. It hurts too much when I try to bend it. And there's some redness spreading up from the incision site—maybe about two inches above the wound now.

Nurse: Understood. Are you taking your prescribed antibiotics and analgesics exactly as directed? Please tell me the names, dosages, and schedule of each medication.

Patient: Yes, I've been taking everything as prescribed. The pain pills don't seem to be helping much anymore though.

Nurse: Have you observed any drainage from the surgical site? If so, what is the color, amount, and consistency of the fluid? Does it have any odor?

Patient: Yes, there's a bit of yellowish fluid that's started coming out since this morning. Not a lot, but definitely wasn't there yesterday.

Nurse: Thank you. Apart from the knee, have you experienced any chills, rigors, increased fatigue, or loss of appetite? How is your overall energy level?

Patient: I feel more tired today, and I haven't really been hungry. I've just been drinking water and had some toast this morning.

Nurse: Based on your fever of 100.2°F, increased pain and swelling, spreading redness, warmth, and purulent drainage, I am concerned about a possible surgical‐site infection.

Patient: Oh no, is it serious?

Nurse: These findings warrant prompt evaluation. I recommend contacting your surgeon’s office immediately for assessment—potentially today. Would you like me to assist in placing that call now?

Patient: Yes, please. That would be helpful. I'm feeling a bit worried now.

Nurse: I understand your concern. I will contact your surgeon’s office on your behalf. In the meantime, please:

1. Keep your leg elevated above heart level  
2. Do **not** remove or disturb the dressing  
3. Continue all prescribed medications on schedule  
4. Monitor your temperature and note any changes in symptoms  

I will remain on the line until we have connected with your surgical team.
