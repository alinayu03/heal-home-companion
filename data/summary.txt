The call was regarding a follow-up on the patient's knee surgery. The patient reported feeling good and denied any new pain, swelling, or warmth around the surgical site. However, the patient mentioned a temperature reading of 70, which may indicate an error or a potential issue with monitoring. Further evaluation may be needed to ensure accurate temperature monitoring and assess the patient's ability to bear weight on the leg and bend the knee without discomfort.
