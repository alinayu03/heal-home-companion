Summary:

The patient underwent knee surgery last week and is experiencing worsening pain, swelling, warmth, increased redness, and purulent drainage from the surgical site. They have a fever of 100.2°F and difficulty bearing weight or bending the knee. The prescribed pain medication is not providing relief, and the patient is feeling fatigued with decreased appetite. These symptoms raise concerns about a possible surgical-site infection, requiring prompt evaluation by the surgeon. The nurse recommended contacting the surgeon’s office immediately for assessment and advised the patient to keep the leg elevated, avoid disturbing the dressing, continue medications as prescribed, and monitor symptoms closely.
